            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-2">This project aims to provide accessible, engaging, and thoughtfully designed educational content that helps students critically explore the ethics of artificial intelligence. Our mission is to make AI ethics education approachable for STEM students through interactive, visually compelling modules that bridge theory and real-world application. We envision a learning experience that empowers students not only to understand core ethical concepts but also to reflect on how their future work may impact society.</p>

            <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mb-2">Supported by a grant from the Johns Hopkins Center for Teaching Excellence and Innovation (CTEI), this project is an experimental digital learning module currently in development through the Center for Leadership Education. It blends design, pedagogy, and technology to create a short, certificate-based course on AI ethics. The interactive format is meant to support flexible learning while encouraging students to think deeply and critically. The module is still evolving, and ongoing collaboration between developers and instructors ensures it remains aligned with student needs and modern design principles.</p>
