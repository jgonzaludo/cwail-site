  "content": "The earlier recommendations target traditional academic writing. For some non-academic tasks, AI can be a helpful productivity tool when the goal is not to learn or become a better writer.\n\nIf going through the full writing process does not support intellectual growth for a task, outsourcing that task to AI can be reasonable. Use AI where it saves time without undermining learning goals.\n\nYou remain responsible for the quality of both the input (prompts) and the output (reviewing AI results). Authorial judgment still matters: verify accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness of AI-generated outputs.\n\nThink like a writer even when AI does writing: design good prompts and critically review outputs to ensure they meet your goals.",
