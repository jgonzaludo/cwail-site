  "title": "Conclusion",
  "content": "Return to the interview scenario that began the module. You got the interview. During your commute to the ABC Industries facility, you anxiously review your resume and cover letter and the responses you prepared. You recognize this could be your big break.\n\nYour interviewer is older than you expected but warm and good-natured. He consults a ruffled yellow legal pad as he talks. He puts you at ease. You answer most questions with honesty and intelligence and see a smile spread across his face. Then his last question gives you pause.\n\n\"I had a chance to read your response to my little writing prompt. Very interesting. Why did you reach that particular conclusion (that is: 'caution' or 'rapid development')? If you could, please also justify the specific recommendation you came up with.\"\n\nBefore proceeding to the quiz, submit a short written response below addressing that question. Then indicate whether you used AI to generate your earlier response. Neither answer will affect your ability to complete the module or receive a certificate; the goal is reflection.\n\nStudent task:\n- Short-response box: Submit your written answer to the interview prompt.\n- Multiple-choice disclosure: Select one of the following options:\n  1) I didn't use any AI when I wrote my earlier response.\n  2) I consulted an AI tool for help, but I wrote my response myself.\n  3) I used AI to generate most or all of my earlier response.\n  4) Other: [open text box]\n\nUX notes:\n- Render the full scenario text above on the page with a prominent short response textarea and the multiple-choice disclosure below it.\n- Provide a visible \"Submit\" button that saves the response to localStorage and marks the module complete.\n- Do not use an accordion for this module. It must be a single content view that users read and respond to before unlocking the quiz."
