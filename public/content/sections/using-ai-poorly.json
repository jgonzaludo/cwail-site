  "content": "Relying on AI to perform intellectual tasks prevents you from becoming proficient in those tasks. Using AI to bypass, replace, or avoid the writing process is counterproductive because it prevents practicing the behaviors needed to be a good writer.\n\nGood AI uses replace another person or tool. Counterproductive uses replace you.\n\nUsing an LLM to produce a draft could violate academic integrity policies. These policies vary by institution but consequences for violations can be severe.\n\nFrequent misuse of AI can stunt development of clear expression, critical thinking about sources, authorial judgment, and focus—skills you need long-term.",
