  "lead": "The writing process is the discrete series of steps you perform to produce a polished piece of writing. Each step develops intellectual skills valuable beyond a single assignment. Because the boundaries between some steps are ambiguous, different scholars define the steps of the writing process differently. For example, Donald Murray, who popularized the notion of writing-as-process via his 1972 article for The Leaflet, \"Teach Writing as a Process Not Product,\" lists only three steps: prewriting, writing, and rewriting. In this module, we have defined the steps of the writing process in a way that makes sense to us: using the term \"invention\" to encompass both prewriting activities and other kinds of mental work that precede the drafting phase; using the term \"drafting\" rather than \"writing\" to emphasize that the first act of composition is not necessarily the most important or real one; splitting Murray's \"rewriting\" into two categories that we think better describe the kinds of mental work that should follow the first draft. We were inspired by other authorities on writing and pedagogy as we decided how to define the writing process for this module. See, for instance, these resources from Purdue University, The University of Kansas, and The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, all of which define the writing process in different—but no less helpful—ways (for what it's worth, our definition is closest to MIT's).",

In short, you will develop a plan for your writing and prepare to execute that plan.\n\n**Tasks may include:**\n• Brainstorming\n• Audience analysis\n• Prewriting exercises\n• Research\n\n**Skills and competencies you may rely on during this step include:**\n• Creativity\n• Authorial judgment\n• Reading comprehension\n• Summary and synthesis"

      "content": "In this step, you write loosely and freely. You get your ideas on the page without too much consideration for whether you're expressing them optimally. At the end of this step, you've produced a rough version of your writing that you can begin to shape into something more refined.\n\n**Skills and competencies you may rely on during this step include:**\n• Focus\n• Clarity of expression\n• Argumentation"

      "title": "Revision",
      "content": "In this step, you make big, high-order changes to your draft. You move sections, paragraphs, and sentences around so your ideas are easier to follow. You modify your main arguments so that they reflect your evidence better. You get rid of parts that aren't necessary, or add new parts that are. You even return to tasks from earlier in the process, like research, as needed. Then, ideally, you do these things again (and again!), stopping when you're totally happy with the big-picture progression of ideas.\n\n**Skills and competencies you may rely on during this step include:**\n• Organization\n• Argumentation\n• Transitions\n• Editorial judgment"

    {
      "title": "Editing/Publishing",
      "content": "In this step, you make smaller, lower-order changes to your draft in order to get it ready for release. You change words to make your language more powerful or memorable. You read each sentence carefully, fixing errors and removing unneeded complexity as you go. You look for inconsistencies in your formatting, paying special attention to things like punctuation marks, spacing, spelling, capitalization, and the way you're handling your sources. You get a friend to double-check your work.\n\n**Skills and competencies you may rely on during this step include:**\n• Attention to detail\n• Mechanical/grammatical proficiencies\n• Style/voice\n• Formatting\n• Document design\n• Citation practices"
